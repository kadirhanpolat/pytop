## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added

- Core mathematical topology library: degree theory, embeddings, graph topology,
  digital image topology, surface classification, three-manifolds, cosmology topology,
  knot theory, cardinal functions, compactness variants, metrization
- `pytop.experimental` subpackage for research-stage modules (theorem drafts,
  special example spaces, advanced cardinal functions, research bridge profiles)
