## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.6] — 2026-06-18

### Added / Changed

- **Linear-time planarity** (`graph_planarity.py`): `is_planar` now decides
  planarity via the `O(V+E)` **left-right planarity test** (de Fraysseix–
  Rosenstiehl; Brandes 2009) instead of the exponential rotation-system genus
  search. It decides graphs of *any* size and **never raises** — sparse but
  high-degree planar graphs (e.g. wheels `W9…W40`, large grids) that used to
  exceed the search cap and raise `GraphPlanarityError` now return `True`
  instantly. `graph_genus` is unchanged (it still computes the exact minimum
  genus by rotation-system search). A cheap Euler edge bound pre-rejects dense
  graphs and double-checks the LR verdict on them. Validated against networkx's
  independent planarity test on **all** labelled graphs up to 6 vertices
  (33 867 graphs, 0 disagreements) plus thousands of random larger graphs;
  the committed differential test is gated on networkx.

## [0.9.5] — 2026-06-18

### Performance

- **Planarity scale pass** (`graph_planarity.py`): `is_planar` now rejects dense
  graphs by the Euler edge bound (`E ≤ 3V−6`, or `E ≤ 2V−4` for bipartite graphs,
  detected by 2-colouring) per connected component and *before* the rotation-system
  search cap, and the genus search early-terminates at the first genus-0 embedding.
  `is_planar(K4,4)` 16 624 ms → 0.019 ms; dense `Kₙ` / `K_{m,n}` decide in `O(V+E)`.
  Every verdict is identical (pinned by the networkx Boyer–Myrvold oracle).
- **Khovanov SNF memoisation** (`khovanov.py`): each differential's Smith normal
  form was computed three times (outgoing rank, incoming rank, incoming torsion);
  caching it per bidegree cuts SNF work to exactly 1× — 3× fewer SNF calls, `7_1`
  (the (2,7) torus knot) 265 ms → 109 ms. Identical homology (cross-checked against
  the Jones engine for the new 5_1 case).

### Fixed

- `is_planar(K6)` / `is_planar(K7)` (and any graph whose rotation-system space
  exceeds the search cap but which the Euler edge bound rejects) now return `False`
  instead of raising `GraphPlanarityError`.

### Notes

- Persistence was profiled but left unchanged: the Twist+Clearing kernel is already
  bigint-optimised and the reduction (not the filtration) dominates; the next gain
  needs the dual / persistent-cohomology algorithm. The remaining frontiers
  (polynomial planarity, dual persistence) are documented in `docs/COMPLEXITY.md`.

## [0.9.4] — 2026-06-18

### Fixed
- **The codebase is now mypy-clean and mypy is enforced in CI.** `mypy src/pytop/`
  reported 361 errors (57 files) under the existing lenient config; all are
  resolved. The dominant pattern (301) was the copy-pasted `_matches_any` helper
  declaring `candidates: set[str]` while callers pass `frozenset` constants and
  `set` literals interchangeably — widened to `set[str] | frozenset[str]`. Also:
  `nets.py` metadata dicts annotated `dict[str, Any]`; empty-collection locals
  annotated; a `BasisAnalysis`/`FiniteMapAnalysis` variable-reuse renamed; the
  optional `python-flint` import switched to the `importlib` idiom (version-agnostic,
  no `type: ignore`); and ~16 targeted `type: ignore[code]` for descriptive/
  experimental-layer cases mypy cannot follow (runtime covered by the test suite).
  The CI `mypy` step is now blocking (`continue-on-error` removed). No behaviour
  change; suite unchanged (9 950 passed, 16 opt-in oracle tests skipped).

## [0.9.3] — 2026-06-18

### Fixed
- **CI is green again.** The `ruff check src/pytop/` step had been failing since
  ~v0.8.0 on 34 accumulated lint errors in the Phase 1/2 code (none in the
  Phase 3/4 modules): import sorting (I001), unused imports (F401), quoted
  annotations (UP037), a deprecated import (UP035), dead local variables (F841),
  two undefined annotation names (F821 — `Sequence`, `MetricTopologySpace`), and
  ambiguous loop variables `l` → `row` (E741). No behaviour change; the full
  suite is unchanged (9 950 passed, 16 opt-in oracle tests skipped). This is the
  first release with a passing CI run on Python 3.11 / 3.12 / 3.13.

## [0.9.2] — 2026-06-18

### Added
- **P4.8 — SnapPy 3-manifold differential oracle** (`tests/core/test_snappy_oracle.py`,
  opt-in `PYTOP_SNAPPY_ORACLE=1`, Docker-based): SnapPy — the gold-standard 3-manifold
  software — is the one independent oracle for `dehn_surgery`. A single batched run of a
  local `pytop-snappy` image (Python 3.12 + `snappy`) validates `first_homology_of_surgery`
  against SnapPy's Dehn-filling homology: figure-8 knot surgeries (`p/q` → ℤ/p) and
  Whitehead-link surgeries (ℤ/a ⊕ ℤ/b). Both report the invariant-factor form, so they
  match directly. Skipped by default, so the suite stays fast and Docker-free.

### Tests
- **9 950 passing** (+ 16 opt-in SageMath/SnapPy-oracle tests). Runtime stays
  dependency-free (`dependencies = []`).

## [0.9.1] — 2026-06-18

### Added
- **P4.7 — SageMath/GAP differential oracle** (`tests/core/test_sage_oracle.py`,
  opt-in `PYTOP_SAGE_ORACLE=1`, Docker-based): a single batched run of the
  `sagemath/sagemath` image validates pytop's Alexander and Jones polynomials
  against Sage's independent algorithms, and its van Kampen group abelianisations
  against **GAP** (Klein bottle ℤ⊕ℤ/2, torus ℤ², ℝP² ℤ/2, wedge ℤ³). Skipped by
  default, so the suite stays fast and Docker-free.

### Changed
- Corrected the P4.6 flint-backend documentation: a clean re-measurement (the
  earlier apparent slowdown was concurrent machine load) shows FLINT's exact
  Smith normal form is **~5–8× faster** than the pure-Python routine even on
  pytop's *sparse* boundary/Khovanov matrices. The optional `[fast]` backend is
  kept; `docs/COMPLEXITY.md`, the roadmap and README updated accordingly.

### Tests
- **9 950 passing** (+ 8 opt-in SageMath-oracle tests). Runtime stays
  dependency-free (`dependencies = []`).

## [0.9.0] — 2026-06-18

### Added
- **Phase 4 — performance, correctness, interoperability** (merged via PR #17):
  - `exact_linalg` — public exact integer linear algebra: `smith_normal_form`,
    `integer_rank`, `integer_determinant` (fraction-free Bareiss), `cokernel` →
    `AbelianGroup`. `dehn_surgery` shares this core (DRY).
  - **`docs/COMPLEXITY.md`** — an honest reference of the asymptotic cost and
    practical input limits of every computational engine, plus `Complexity`
    notes on the heavy docstrings.

### Testing
- **Property-based + cross-engine differential test suite**
  (`tests/core/test_property_invariants.py`): Euler–Poincaré; rational Betti =
  integral free rank; `b_i(ℤ/p) ≥ b_i(ℚ)`; HOMFLY-PT Markov (±) / conjugation
  invariance; braid Alexander palindromy; HOMFLY-PT `a=1` = Burau Alexander;
  Dehn-surgery `|H₁| = |det|`; lens-space homeomorphic ⇒ homotopy-equivalent.
- **Differential testing against five independent external oracles**
  (`tests/core/test_external_oracles.py`, test-only `oracles` extra; each block
  skips when its oracle is absent): **sympy** and **python-flint** (exact linear
  algebra), **networkx** (Boyer–Myrvold planarity), **numpy** (signature), and
  **GUDHI** (Vietoris–Rips persistence — first external validation of the TDA
  engine against the gold standard).

### Performance
- **Optional flint-accelerated exact Smith normal form** (`fast` extra): when
  `python-flint` is installed, large dense integer SNFs route to FLINT — identical
  results (the pure-Python routine remains the default and only hard requirement),
  but a dense 30×30 SNF drops from a multi-second coefficient blow-up to ~2 ms,
  speeding up every homology / cohomology / cellular / Khovanov / surgery engine
  built on the SNF. `numpy`/`scipy` are floating-point and cannot accelerate the
  exact core; only a fast exact library (FLINT) can.

### Tests
- **9 950 tests passing** (+42 since v0.8.0). Runtime stays dependency-free
  (`dependencies = []`); the oracle/accelerator libraries are optional extras.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-06-18

### Added
- **Phase 3 geometric & low-dimensional topology** (merged via PR #16). Five new pure-Python,
  dependency-free computational modules:
  - `seifert` — Seifert algorithm from an oriented PD code: `seifert_circles`,
    `seifert_genus_bound`, `seifert_matrix`, `signature` (Sylvester LDLT, no numpy).
  - `LinkDiagram` + `linking_number` / `linking_matrix` (`knot_invariants`) — multi-component
    link diagrams and integer linking invariants.
  - `homfly` — HOMFLY-PT `P(a, z)` from a braid closure via skein recursion
    `a·P(L₊) − a⁻¹·P(L₋) = z·P(L₀)` (descending-defect termination); `Laurent2` two-variable
    Laurent ring; `to_jones()` / `to_alexander()` specialisations. Certified a genuine invariant
    via Markov stabilisation (±) and conjugation.
  - `multivariable_alexander` — `Δ_L(t₁,…,tₙ)` from a `LinkDiagram` via a Wirtinger presentation
    (arcs + intrinsic orientation by component tracing) and Fox calculus over the n-variable
    Laurent ring; `(c−1)`-minor determinant `÷ (t_γ−1)` for links. Replaces the prior stub.
  - `dehn_surgery` — `H₁(M)` of rational/integral Dehn surgery as the SNF cokernel of
    `A_{ii}=pᵢ, A_{ij}=qᵢ·lk(Lᵢ,Lⱼ)`; `first_homology_of_link_surgery`;
    `lens_space_first_homology` + lens-space homeomorphism/homotopy classification;
    `FirstHomology` result type.
  - `khovanov` — Khovanov homology `Kh^{i,j}` with integral **torsion** (cube of resolutions →
    Frobenius algebra `ℤ⟨1,X⟩` with `m`/`Δ` → per-quantum-grading SNF); `KhovanovHomology` with
    graded Euler characteristic.

### Validation
- Differential tests against existing engines (HOMFLY → Jones/Alexander; multivariable Alexander →
  braid Alexander; Khovanov graded Euler characteristic → `jones_polynomial`); known 3-manifolds
  (lens spaces, S¹×S², T³, the Poincaré homology sphere via the E₈ plumbing, L(7,1)≃L(7,2));
  published integral Khovanov groups (trefoil ℤ/2 at (−2,−7), figure-8, Hopf); and `d²=0`.

### Tests
- **9 908 tests passing** (+144 since v0.7.0).

## [0.7.0] — 2026-06-18

### Added
- **Phase 2 algebraic topology — complete (8/8)** (merged via PR #15):
  - `mayer_vietoris` — Mayer–Vietoris LES; extended SNF with transformation matrices;
    φ, ψ, δ as integer matrices; exactness verified at every position.
  - `cellular_homology` — CW complex chain complex → SNF; standard spaces S^n, RP^n,
    CP^n, T², Klein bottle, lens spaces, Moore spaces; `cw_from_simplicial` bridge.
  - `cohomology` — cochain complex δ^k=(∂_{k+1})^T; UCT verified; Alexander-Whitney
    cup product; `CohomologyRing` with `verify_graded_commutativity()`.
  - `van_kampen` — Seifert–van Kampen; GroupPresentation + GroupHomomorphism; amalgamated
    free product; Tietze elimination (cyclic reduction + deduplication); abelianization via
    SNF; `cw_complex_pi1` with disconnected-skeleton guard.
  - `persistent_homology_optimized` — Twist algorithm (Chen–Kerber 2011) + Clearing Lemma;
    `ReductionStats`; shared `_twist_reduce` kernel; **bigint bitmask (~6.6× kernel speedup)**.
  - `cubical_homology` — `CubicalComplex`; `bitmap_to_cubical_filtration`; `persistent_homology_bitmap`.
  - `homology_coefficients` — field-coefficient (Q, Z/p) and relative homology; prime-modulus validation.
- **Phase 1 extensions**: `AlexandroffSpace`, `SubbaseSpace`, `InverseLimitSpace`; cardinal invariants;
  Urysohn witnesses (`DiscreteCountableSpace` → discrete metric); π₁ via McCord order complex.
- **`_snf_ext(compute_transforms=False)`** — skips P/Pinv/Q/Qinv when only D is needed (~80% saving).

### Fixed
- 5 HIGH correctness bugs: `is_hausdorff` certificate bypass; `_close_under_unions` deduplication;
  `_provable_true_props` recursion guard; `_product_pi1` silent exception; Mayer–Vietoris
  torsion-aware exactness check.
- 15 MEDIUM bugs across all Phase 1/2 modules (midpoint formula, union-find refactor, torus
  `group_type` → `"free_abelian_rank_2"`, `QuotientSpace.contains` raises `NotImplementedError`, etc.).

### Tests
- **9 764 tests passing** (+729 since v0.6.0).

### Added
- **Computable space protocol (Milestone S1, experimental)** — `pytop.experimental.spaces`:
  a `Space` representation protocol unifying finite and finitely-presented infinite spaces
  (cofinite, order topology on ℚ, exact metric, opaque), a decidability-honest `Verdict`
  (decided / semi-decidable / undecidable, with witness or counterexample), and a generic
  `is_hausdorff` that computes on finite spaces, uses construction certificates on infinite
  ones, and honestly reports undecidable otherwise. First step of the research-grade roadmap
  (see `docs/CAPABILITIES_AND_ROADMAP.md`).
- **Space predicates & construction closure (Milestone S2, experimental)** — generalized the
  `certificate` interface to any property and added witness-producing predicates `is_t0`, `is_t1`,
  `is_regular`, `is_normal`, `is_compact`, `is_connected` (finite spaces computed from the topology;
  infinite spaces via construction certificates; honest `UNDECIDABLE` otherwise — e.g. compactness
  of a generic metric space). Added finite construction closure — `subspace`, `binary_product`,
  `disjoint_sum`, `quotient` — each returning a `FiniteSpace`, so predicates compose on constructed
  spaces (a product of Hausdorff spaces is computed and verified Hausdorff).
- **Property-reasoning engine (Milestone S3, experimental)** — `pytop.experimental.spaces.reasoning`:
  derives properties of *constructed* spaces — including **infinite** ones, without enumeration — by
  combining construction-preservation theorems (subspace→hereditary, product→productive/Tychonoff,
  sum→coproduct-stable, quotient→image-stable), the pi-Base implication graph, and computed/certified
  leaf verdicts. `derive(space, prop)` returns a `Derivation` with a human-readable explanation tree;
  `explain` renders it; `synthesize(has=…, lacks=…)` searches for a space meeting a property spec.
  E.g. a product of a cofinite and an order space is derived T1; a subspace of an infinite metric
  space is derived regular — each with a proof, no points enumerated.
- **Preservation table cross-validation (experimental)** — the pi-Base ETL now also extracts
  property **meta-properties** (heredity / productivity / disjoint-union flags), exposed via
  `pi_base.property_meta`. A test suite cross-validates the reasoning engine's hand-curated
  `PRESERVATION` table against them in the no-contradiction direction (pi-Base's meta-properties
  are sparse, so they confirm but do not drive the table). Grounds the preservation theorems in
  the referenced database.
- **Extended axioms & representations (Milestone S4, experimental)** — added composite separation
  predicates `is_t3` (regular + T1) and `is_t4` (normal + T1), and the countability/covering
  predicates `is_lindelof`, `is_separable`, `is_second_countable`, `is_first_countable` (trivially
  true on finite spaces; via certificates on infinite ones). Added two representations:
  `SorgenfreyLineSpace` (separable, first-countable, Lindelöf, **not** second-countable, normal) and
  `DiscreteCountableSpace`; extended the cofinite/order/metric certificates accordingly (a generic
  metric space is first-countable but its separability stays honestly undecided).
- **Full separation hierarchy & reasoning extension (Milestone S5, experimental)** — added the
  predicates `is_tychonoff` (T3.5), `is_t5`, `is_t6` (on finite spaces these collapse to T1 = discrete;
  on infinite spaces they use certificates). Extended the reasoning engine's property vocabulary and
  `PRESERVATION` table to all 16 properties with correct construction rules (e.g. Lindelöf and normal
  are **not** productive; second-countable and Tychonoff are hereditary/productive). The engine now
  distinguishes the rational plane Q² (second-countable ⟹ Lindelöf and, via Urysohn metrization,
  normal/T4) from the **Sorgenfrey plane** (regular but famously not Lindelöf and not normal) — by
  preservation plus the pi-Base implication graph, with no enumeration. This completes the core of
  Phase 1 (set-theoretic topology) of the research-grade roadmap.
- **pi-Base atlas ↔ reasoning bridge (experimental)** — `pytop.experimental.spaces.pi_base_space`
  wraps any of the 222 famous pi-Base spaces as a protocol `Space` whose property certificates come
  from pi-Base's deduced trait matrix. The reasoning engine's predicates and `derive` now work on
  famous spaces (Cantor set, long line, real line, …), and those spaces feed into the construction
  wrappers — e.g. `ProductSpace([pi_base_space("Cantor set"), pi_base_space("Cantor set")])` is
  derived compact (Tychonoff). `analyze_pi_base_space(name)` reports all 16 property verdicts.
- **Homology with field coefficients & relative homology (Phase 2, algebraic topology)** —
  `homology_with_coefficients` / `betti_numbers_over` compute ``H_*(K; F)`` over `Q` or `Z/p` by
  Gaussian elimination over the field, and `relative_homology` / `relative_betti_numbers` compute
  ``H_*(K, L; Z)`` for a subcomplex `L`. Demonstrates coefficient dependence — the real projective
  plane has ``H_1(RP^2; Q) = 0`` but ``H_1(RP^2; Z/2) = Z/2`` — and relative homology
  ``H_2(D^2, ∂D^2) = Z``. First step of Phase 2 of the research-grade roadmap.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- **Constructive computational core** — genuine invariant computation from
  raw input, complementing the descriptive profile layer:
  - `homology.py` — integral simplicial homology of a finite `SimplicialComplex`:
    oriented `boundary_matrix`, integer Smith normal form, `simplicial_homology` /
    `homology_groups` / `betti_numbers` (free rank **and** torsion coefficients),
    `reduced_homology`, and `euler_characteristic_via_homology` (cross-checks the
    combinatorial Euler characteristic). Verified on S¹, S², T² (H₁ = ℤ²) and
    ℝP² (H₁ = ℤ/2 torsion).
  - `persistent_homology.py` — real TDA engine added alongside the existing profiles:
    `vietoris_rips_filtration` of a finite metric space, `persistence_pairs` via the
    standard ℤ/2 column reduction, plus `barcode`, `persistence_diagram` and
    `euler_characteristic_curve`.
  - `knot_invariants.py` — `kauffman_bracket` and `jones_polynomial` from a planar-diagram
    code, `alexander_polynomial_from_braid` via the reduced Burau representation, `writhe`,
    `linking_number`, and `is_valid_pd_code`. Verified: trefoil Jones = −t⁻⁴+t⁻³+t⁻¹,
    figure-eight Jones = t⁻²−t⁻¹+1−t+t², Alexander(trefoil) = t−1+t⁻¹.
  - `experimental/convergence_spaces.py` — finite convergence spaces (Dolecki's "royal road"):
    `ConvergenceSpace` with `is_convergence_space` / `is_pretopology` / `is_pseudotopology` /
    `is_topological`, the mutually inverse `convergence_from_topology` ↔
    `topology_from_convergence` bridges, `is_continuous_convergence_map`, and `grill_of_filter`.
  - **pi-Base deductive inference** (`experimental/pi_base.py` + `pi_base_atlas.py`) — a real
    deductive property-inference engine over the pi-Base database (243 properties, 902 implication
    theorems, 222 spaces / 2099 traits; CC BY 4.0, Clontz & Dabbs). `deduce` computes the closure of
    known traits (forward chaining + contrapositive over compound and/or/not formulas) and detects
    contradictions; `find_counterexamples(has=…, lacks=…)` searches the atlas (e.g. compact but not
    Hausdorff); `steen_seebach_index` links to *Counterexamples in Topology* numbers. Data compiled
    by `_internal/pi_base_compile.py`; loaded with stdlib `json` only (no runtime dependency). A
    cross-validation test suite pins pytop's hand-encoded implications against the pi-Base graph.
  - `winding_number.py` — `winding_number`, `circle_map_degree` (degree of S¹→S¹ maps), and
    `vector_field_index` (index of an isolated planar zero) from sampled geometric data.
  - `surface_word_classification.py` — `classify_surface_word`: closed-surface classification from a
    polygon gluing word via corner identification → Euler characteristic, orientability, genus
    (sphere / torus / ℝP² / Klein bottle / genus-g). Verified incl. genus-2 and ℝP²#ℝP² = Klein.
  - `graph_planarity.py` — exact `is_planar` / `graph_genus` for small graphs via rotation-system
    search (K5, K3,3, Petersen non-planar; genus additive over components), plus the Euler edge bound.

  metadata, attribute paths), bool value edge case, benchmark names (Cantor Set,
  R^n, euclidean_N), zero-dimensional tag path, `has_clopen_base` (all 4 explicit
  branches + dim=0 with representation variants), `is_zero_dimensional` (ind=0

  missing reflexive, non-transitive triples, callable net values, invalid net
  value type, symbolic space fallthrough, missing values, values-outside-carrier,
  all 4 `analyze_net` dispatch paths (none/subset/space+point/directed-only)
  — `nets.py` coverage: 84% → 100%
- 28 new tests in `test_filters_extended.py`: empty family, empty-set-in-base,
  outside-carrier elements, failed intersection pair, invalid filter (F1/F2/F3
  failures), symbolic space fallthrough, point-not-in-carrier, no open neighborhoods,
  missing coarser members, failed neighborhood-member pairs, `analyze_filter`
  invalid-filter early exit, point+coarser dispatch
  — `filters.py` coverage: 84% → 100%
- 42 new tests in `test_infinite_maps_extended.py` + `test_infinite_image_preimage_extended.py`:
  `EmbeddingMap`/`ConstantMap` constructors, `normalize_map_property` ValueError,
  all 5 uncovered `is_*` shortcuts, `infinite_map_report`, `identity_map`,
  `compose_maps` embedding branch, `initial_topology_descriptor` error paths,
  `_has_positive/negative_tag` via metadata, theorem implications (homeomorphism→open/closed,

  `SymbolicSubset.add_tags`, `image_space` surjective path,
  `preimage_subset` closed tag, `image_subset` connected/path_connected,

  — `infinite_maps.py`: 84% → 100%; `infinite_image_preimage.py`: 86% → 100%
- Total: 2302 tests, 95.05% coverage

### CI / DevOps
- Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: runs `pytest --cov` on Python 3.11, 3.12, 3.13
  via GitHub Actions on every push/PR to master
- Added `[project.optional-dependencies] dev` to `pyproject.toml` (`pip install -e ".[dev]"`)
- Raised `fail_under` from 60 → 90 in `[tool.coverage.report]`
- Added CI badge to `README.md`
- Added `ruff>=0.4` and `mypy>=1.10` to `dev` dependencies
- Added `[tool.ruff]` and `[tool.mypy]` config to `pyproject.toml`
- Applied ruff auto-fixes: import sorting, `List[X]→list[X]`, deprecated typing imports
  (`from typing import Callable/Mapping/...` → `from collections.abc import ...`),
  unused `typing.Dict/List` artifacts, f-string modernization, quoted annotation removal
- Fixed 2 genuine `__init__.py` bugs: duplicate `neighborhood_system` import and
  duplicate `homeomorphism_criterion_result`/`initial_topology_descriptor` in import block
- Added `ruff check` step to CI (fails on error); added `mypy` step (continue-on-error)
- Mypy reports 48 type annotations to improve (tracked for future work)

## [0.4.2] - 2026-05-15

### Fixed
- Removed 112 broken `__all__` entries from `__init__.py` that referenced
  `_internal/` audit tools not present in the public namespace

### Changed
- Added explicit `__all__` to 9 core modules: `connectedness`, `countability`,
  `local_compactness`, `compactness_variants`, `dimension_theory`, `invariants`,
  `uniform_spaces`, `inverse_systems`

### Tests
- 204 new tests: `preservation_legacy` (100%), `metric_contracts` (91%),
  `finite_witness_diagnostics` (96%), `metrization_profiles` (98%),
  `uniform_spaces` (98%), `inverse_systems`
- Total: 1929 tests, 92% coverage

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-15

### Changed
- Removed four empty stub modules (`bases`, `sums`, `exceptions`, `infinite_splittings`)
- Cleaned up stale v0.1.64 version aliases from `preservation_tables` public imports
- Added `examples_bank/` to test sys.path in `conftest.py`
- Added Cilt/corridor terminology glossary to `CLAUDE.md`

### Fixed
- `SyntaxWarning` from invalid escape sequence in `test_cilt3_local_compactness_v056.py`
- Fragile exact-dict equality in `test_theorem_profile_alignment.py` replaced with subset checks

### Tests
- 73 new tests for `metric_completeness`, `result_rendering`, and `predicate_contracts`
- Total: 1578 tests, 86% coverage

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- Initial standalone release extracted from the pytop textbook ecosystem
- Core mathematical topology library: degree theory, embeddings, graph topology,
  digital image topology, surface classification, three-manifolds, cosmology topology,
  knot theory, cardinal functions, compactness variants, metrization
- `pytop.experimental` subpackage for research-stage modules (theorem drafts,
  special example spaces, advanced cardinal functions, research bridge profiles)
- Comprehensive test suite: 1509 tests across `tests/core/` and `tests/experimental/`
- `examples_bank/`: 83 topic-based Markdown example files

### Notes
- `pytop_pedagogy`, `pytop_publish`, and `pytop_questionbank` are intentionally
  excluded — this package contains only the mathematical core
